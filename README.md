# Recursive Calculator

# Introduction
This repository contains a Recursive Calculator with Memory. The project aims to build a calculator that supports various mathematical operations, both unary and binary, with the added functionality of memory storage.

# Description
The Recursive Calculator is a command-line application that enables users to perform calculations involving real numbers and utilize memory storage for values. The calculator supports a range of operations, including absolute value, sine, cosine, exponential, logarithm, rounding, ceiling, floor, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The project is implemented using a recursive approach, emphasizing the importance of recursion in solving complex problems. It adheres to a strict rule of not utilizing any iterative constructs, such as loops, making it a valuable exercise in mastering recursive programming techniques.

# Features
- Performs calculations involving unary and binary operations with real numbers.
- Utilizes memory storage to save and recall values.
- Handles complex expressions through recursive evaluation.
- Interactive user interface through command-line prompts.
- Avoids the use of iterative constructs, relying solely on recursion.
- Promotes skill development in string and array manipulation.
- Provides practical experience in problem-solving and programming.
